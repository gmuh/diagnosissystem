 <strong class="strong">HOW TO DO THE BLOOD TESTS FOR MALARIA </strong>
<p class="p">To do the blood test, first you draw blood from a finger prick. Then, you first do the RDT, and then the slide test. Let us learn how to do this, step by step. </p>
<p class="p"> Drawing blood from a finger-prick </p>
<p class="p">What you require to draw blood:<br/>  1.  Spirit swab <br /> 2. Cotton <br/>3. Lancet </p>
<p class="p">How to draw blood from a finger-prick: <br /> 1. Clean the ring or middle finger (either of the two fingers next to the little finger) of the left hand of the patient with the spirit swab.<br />  2. Select the part of the finger tip a little away from the center (this area becomes red if gently pressed) but not too close to the nail on the side.<br/> 3. This part of the finger should be pricked with a lancet, using one quick, firm movement
<p class="p"><br />4. Gently wipe the tip of the finger with cotton, and then allow the blood to flow out on its own.<br /> 5. If blood does not come out freely, then gently press the tip of the finger.   
As described later, it is important for your safety and for the safety of the patient, that you do not touch the sharp tip of the lancet or directly touch the blood with your bare fingers.</p>
<strong class="strong"> Doing a Rapid Diagnosis Test (RDT) </strong>
<p class="p">What you require for doing a Rapid Test:<br />  
To do a Rapid Diagnosis Test (RDT), you need a Rapid Diagnosis Test Kit (RDK). This kit will be regularly supplied to you by the government through the nearest Primary Health Center. The kit contains the following materials:   
1. Spirit swabs - one swab for one patient<br /> 2. Lancets - one lancet for one patient<br /> 3. Small glass tube (capillary tube) - one for each patient<br /> 4. Test strips - one strip for one patient<br />  5. One multiple-well plastic plate - common for all tests<br /> 6. Test tube  one test tube for one patient<br /> 7. Buffer solution or reagent solution - a special liquid for doing the test, in a dropper bottle, common for all tests.</p>
